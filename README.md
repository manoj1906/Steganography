# Steganography
🔐 Steganography in BMP Images using C
Hide and retrieve secret messages within BMP image files without altering their visual appearance.

This project demonstrates a simple and effective steganography technique using the C programming language. It allows you to encode secret text data into a .bmp image file and decode it back without affecting the visible quality of the image.

💡 Features
Encode Mode: Embed a secret message (from secret.txt) into a 24-bit BMP image (beautiful.bmp) without changing how it looks.

Decode Mode: Extract the hidden message from the encoded BMP image and save it to a new .txt file.

Preserves Image Integrity: Ensures the image remains visually unchanged.

Use Case – Watermarking: Perfect for invisible watermarking and identifying copyright ownership in shared multimedia content.
